# FlappybirdBOT

Little experiment using neural network to create a bot that learns how to play flappy bird on it's own from random settings in it's neural network. 
I still need to read some documentation, but this was made with the neat-python library.
Problem: the game is so simple, that starting with like 50 birds will probably have the right settings 
by chance but you can see the model evolve better with around 15-20 birds.
